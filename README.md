## Problem
With the growth of eCommerce websites, people and financial companies rely on online services to carry out their transactions, leading to an exponential increase in credit card fraud. The design of an efficient fraud detection system is necessary in order to reduce the loss incurred by customers and financial companies.

## Proposed System(Milestones)
    * Data-preparation:
    We are planning to use Oversampling, Undersampling, and SMOTE techniques to counter the imbalanced dataset.

    * Feature Engineering:
    We will be using Feature Engineering techniques like Random Feature Elimination and Boruta Algorithm, to capture all the important features within our dataset.

    * Machine learning Algorithms:
    With this balanced and well-formed dataset, we are planning to run it on different
    ML Algorithms
